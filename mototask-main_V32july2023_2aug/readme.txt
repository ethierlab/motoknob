The code you provided includes reward and stimulation logic for a mototrak behavioral experiment. Here's an overview of how these components are implemented:

1. Reward Logic:
   - When a trial is successful (the rat turns the knob and holds it within a specified range for a certain duration), a reward is given.
   - The `reward_sound` variable is created using the `speaker_sounds` function, which generates a sound for the reward.
   - The variable `num_rewards` keeps track of the total number of rewards given during the experiment.
   - The number of rewards is displayed in the GUI using the `NumRewardsCounterLabel` object.
   - Pellets are delivered as rewards by triggering the feeder using the `moto.trigger_feeder(1)` function. The number of pellets delivered is updated in the GUI.
   - The total number of pellets (including manually fed pellets) and their weight are displayed in the GUI as well.
   - The reward logic also includes a delay between pellet deliveries, controlled by the `pellets_pause` parameter.

2. Stimulation Logic:
   - Stimulation is added to the experiment in specific conditions or randomly in certain trials.
   - The stimulation parameters are set based on user input in the GUI, such as stimulation rate (`stimRate`).
   - If the `StimCond` variable is set to 2 (indicating random stimulation), a random order of trials is generated (`RandTrialOrder`), and a binary array (`RandStimIndex`) is created to represent which trials should receive stimulation.
   - During each trial, if the trial number matches the randomly selected trials for stimulation (`RandStimIndex(num_trials)`), stimulation is performed.
   - Stimulation is triggered using the `moto.trigger_stim()` function, and the number of stimulations is recorded in the `num_stimulations` variable.
   - The number of stimulations is displayed in the GUI using the `NumStimulationsCounterLabel` object.
   - There are different conditions for stimulation, indicated by the `StimCond` variable. For example, if `StimCond` is set to 1, stimulation is performed when the trial is successful and the peak value exceeds a certain threshold (`historical_hit_thresh_max - 20`).

These reward and stimulation components enhance the mototrak behavioral experiment by providing positive reinforcement (rewards) and additional stimuli (stimulation) to the rats based on their performance during the trials.
